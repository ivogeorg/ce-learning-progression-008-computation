2. Read and follow the [lesson-and-assignment](lesson-and-assignment.md).
2. Refer to the [submission template](submission-template.md) for formatting expectations and examples. 
4. Refer to the [criteria and guide](criteria-and-guide.md) for the different components of your submission.

### JavaScript

1. Technically, the language which is used side-by-side with Blocks in the Makecode ronment is a subset of [TypeScript](https://makecode.com/language), which itself is a superset of JavaScript (technically, [ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#Title)), with some JS features not implemented in Makecode.
2. The limited [JavaScript mini-tutorial](https://makecode.microbit.org/javascript) in Makecode.
3. Official [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html):
   1. TypeScript in 5 min [tutorial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html). _Note: You will need to [download](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links) and install an integrated development environment (IDE). The two that I recommend are Visual Studio Code from Microsoft and WebStorm from JetBrains._
   2. The full documentation and reference is under _Handbook_. Bear in mind that you are drinking from the hose. Don't be surprised if not everything is presented in a strictly incremental manner.
4. In-browser TypeScript [playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html). Note that micro:bit specific code will not run, but you can still play. _Start making the distinction between a generic multi-purpose programming language (TypeScript) and functionality (packages, libraries, objects, etc.) that is specific to a particular device (micro:bit), though written in the same programming language._
5. A pretty good and very palatable JS tutorial with in-browser coding, by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript).
6. Extensive and detailed [JS tutorial](https://javascript.info/), with some advanced material thrown in. **I like this one!**
7. The most authoritative JS resource on the Web, including tutorials and reference, by [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).
